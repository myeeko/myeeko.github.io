### About Myeeko :tada:
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

This is where I share my coding adventures and projects. You'll find a mix of personal projects and collaborations. I update this when i feel inspired so regular updates are a bit of a hit and miss. 

I'm particularly interested in:
* HMTL
* CSS
* Javascript
* Python
* json

You'll see examples of that in several of my repositories. The projects here are a mix of polished finished products and works in progress, both being valuable parts of my learning journey. :sparkles:

Kind Regards,

Myeeko
